# PowerShell-Scripting
Here are my instructions below on how to use the PowerShell script I developed.

## Instructions to use:
In the Windows PowerShell console, 
```powershell
Install-Module Selenium -Scope CurrentUser # This gives us the Selenium framework that allows us to manipulate the web browser.

Install-Module ImportExcel -Scope CurrentUser # This allows us to import/export data easily from Excel spreadsheets.
```
It will ask you if you trust the repositories -- go ahead and press [Y] to trust them.
