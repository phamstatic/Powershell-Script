# PowerShell-Scripting
Here are my instructions below on how to use the PowerShell script I developed.
**need to add download edge webdriver instructions
## Instructions to use:
In the Windows PowerShell console, 
```powershell
Install-Module Selenium -Scope CurrentUser # This gives us the framework that allows us to manipulate the web browser.
```
It will ask you if you trust the repository -- go ahead and press [Y] to trust them as it is downloaded straight from the PowerShell Gallery.
